## Hi there 👋


- I am a third-year Finance and Information Systems double major at the University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business
- I am currently working on a Python API integrated project that pulls from Yahoo Finance API and shows a stocks earnings, historical price data, and a summary of their key financial metrics. This is titled Yahoo-Finance-Data-Pipeline in my repos.
- With this project, I plan on doing financial modeling potentially comparing different tickers and different markets in general, (NYSE, NASDAQ, etc).
- Also, I plan on doing some data visualization through Google Looker Studio as part of my Business Intelligence class some data from Yahoo's API.
