## Hi there 👋


- I am a third-year Finance and Information Systems double major at the University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business
- I am currently working on a Python API integrated project that pulls from Yahoo Finance API and shows recent commodity data changes. I chose to start this project due to an interest in commodity futures and the soaring price of precious metals like gold and silver.
