## Hi there 👋


- I am a third-year Finance and Information Systems double major at the University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business
- I am currently working on a Python API integrated project that pulls from Yahoo Finance API and shows a stocks earnings, historical price data, and a summary of their key financial metrics. This is titled Yahoo-Finance-Data-Pipeline in my repos.
